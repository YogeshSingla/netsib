## Question
Compare the performance of OLSR (UM-OLSR) and TORA in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput and end to end delay. Plot graphs for comparison.
Take x- axis – Number of nodes in the network ( 20 (19 source node, 1 sink node), 40, 60, 80, 100)
Y-axis should contain the performance metrics mentioned above.
Traffic Type – CBR
Packet size – 512 bytes
X-dimension of topography – 100 m
Y-dimension of topography – 100 m
Node’s movement - Static
Note: Use new trace file format for analysing the trace files obtained from the above simulations.
