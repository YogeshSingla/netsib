## Question
Add energy model for AODV, DSDV and DSR protocols and print energy of each node. Compare these protocols in terms of energy consumption.  

Take x- axis – Number of nodes in the network ( 10, 20, 30, 40, ...,100)

Y-axis should contain the performance metrics mentioned above.
Traffic Type – CBR
Packet size – 512 bytes
X-dimension of topography – 100 m
Y-dimension of topography – 100 m
Node’;s movement - Static
Note: Use new trace file format for analysing the trace files obtained from the above simulations.
