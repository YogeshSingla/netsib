# Final Group Evaluation 
## Question
Propose a new cluster head selection method for PEGASIS routing protocol. Compare it with existing PEGASIS protocol in terms of number of nodes alive, energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and end to end delay. (Take number of nodes as 10,20,30,40...100)

## Theory

## Execution 
### Challenges
**Ns-2.34/ is the last version with a 'mac/' setup that allows the "MIT leach" to be used.**
